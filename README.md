# Flight Network Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing airline flight networks using graph theory.  
The main goal is to identify **connected components** (isolated flight clusters) and compare the performance of **DFS** and **BFS** implementations.  

### Key Features:
- Load flight datasets without using Pandas (via `csv`).
- Custom **DFS** and **BFS** implementations for connected components detection.
- Runtime benchmarking of DFS vs BFS on different dataset sizes.
- Graph visualization with **matplotlib** and **NetworkX** (including weighted edges).
- Analysis of isolated airports and network connectivity.

### Run in Google Colab
